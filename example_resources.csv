The Teeter family contributed, mainly through the presence of Lillian Teeter, to the culture and history of Carbondale. Lillian Teeter was the focus of a book about Carbondale entitled Miss Lillian's Town and kept a great deal of correspondence and family artifacts that lend a unique perspective of the history of Carbondale, from the point of view of a family spanning from the end of the 19th century to her death in 1977. This collection also contains family artifacts, including a small coffee pot that may be from either the Spanish American War, or H.H. Teeter's famous filter invention. Special files in the Teeter Family collection include letters concerning the planning of the East St. Louis High School 50-year class reunion in 1973 which was filmed by Darren McGavin and issued as a movie titled ""American Reunion"".

The papers range in years from 1772-1801 and find Allen at many locales while pursuing his mercantile business.  Letters from Allen originate in Boston, Philadelphia, New York, Savannah, and Quebec and London.  Many of Levi's letters are to his wife Nancy and to Ira, his brother.  Other notable correspondents are Samuel Rogers, preacher and elected Bishop of Vermont, and Hugh Finlay, Canadian merchant who was responsible for the establishment of the Provincial postal service.  Box 2 folder 4 contains a 1797 note book of Allen's which is full of poetry, historical observations, and memoirs written in a humorous/sarcastic fashion.
