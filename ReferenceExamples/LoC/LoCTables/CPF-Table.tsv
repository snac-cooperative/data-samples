"<biogHist><head>Biographical Note</head><p>John Dildine and Ginny Dildine became familiar figures on the folk music scene in the 1960s, performing at various festivals, schools, and other venues. Around 1965 they began to incorporate puppetry into their stage performances. The puppets were designed by Ginny and either hand-operated or worn as costumes. Over the years the Dildine children (Scott, Debbie, and Connie) joined their parents onstage for musical performances, and to help operate the puppets. Among John’s many accomplishments, he was also the host of folk music programs on Washington, D.C.-area radio stations WASH and WAMU-FM (from 1957-1970) and was the first president of the Folklore Society of Greater Washington (1964-1965).</p></biogHist>"	"John Dildine and Ginny Dildine papers 1957-20141957-1995, 1957-20141957-1995  (Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress)"	https://hdl.loc.gov/loc.afc/eadafc.af019006	"Dildine, John"
