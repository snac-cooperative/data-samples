Jones/Arnie Zane Company was established in 1982 by dancers Bill T. Jones and Arnie Zane (1948–1988). Prior to founding the Company, they had collaborated for eleven years, refining the duet form and adressing issues of identity, form and social commentary. The Company they created has performed worldwide in over 200 cities in 40 countries on every major continent, and is recognized as one of the most innovative and powerful forces in the dance-theater world.</p><p>The repertory of the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Company is widely varied in its subject matter; visual imagery; and stylistic approach to movement, voice, and stagecraft. The Company is noted for its collaborative method of creation with such artists as Keith Haring, Cassandra Wilson, The Orion String Quartet, the Chamber Society of Lincoln Center, Fred Hersch, Jenny Holzer, Robert Longo, Julius Hemphill, and Daniel Bernard Roumain. The collaborations between the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company and visual artists were the subject of "Art Performs Life" (1998), an exhibition at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, MN. Prominent dancers who performed with the Company include Arthur Aviles, Janet Lilly, and Lawrence Goldhuber.</p><p>The Company's notable evening-length works include Last Supper at Uncle Tom's Cabin/The Promised Land (1990, Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music); Still/Here (1994, Biennale de la Danse in Lyon, France); We Set Out Early… Visibility Was Poor (1996, Hancher Auditorium, Iowa City, IA); You Walk?

In 1964, he earned a Bachelor's degree from Syracuse University and moved to New York City to pursue a career in music as a guitarist and songwriter. Reed formed the Velvet Underground with John Cale, Sterling Morrison, and Moe Tucker in 1965, and released four studio albums with the band, before embarking on a solo career in 1970.</p><p>Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Reed released fifteen studio albums, four live albums, and toured frequently in support of his records. He started off 1990 by again collaborating with John Cale, which ultimately set in motion a Velvet Underground reunion tour in 1993. Three years later, and shortly after the death of Sterling Morrison, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p><p>Between 1991 and 2011, Reed released six studio albums, seven live albums, and two career-spanning anthologies. He continued to tour frequently, and also published two books of lyrics and three photography books. On October 27, 2013, Reed died of liver failure at his home in East Hampton, New York.

He is best known for his 1949 book, The Hero with a Thousand Faces, which introduced the concept of the monomyth, Campbell's theory that the archetypical hero's journey is shared across world mythologies.</p><title>The Hero with a Thousand Faces</title><p>Campbell was born in White Plains, New York on March 26, 1905, and grew up in New Rochelle, New York. Campbell graduated from the Canterbury School, in New Milford, Connecticut in 1921, and began classes at Dartmouth College. Two years later, Campbell transferred to Columbia University, where he earned a Bachelor's degree in English Literature in 1925, and a Master's degree in Arthurian Studies in 1927. Campbell spent the following two years studying in Europe at the University of Paris and University of Munich.</p><p>Upon returning from Europe, Campbell moved to Woodstock, New York, and began writing short fiction and novels. Between 1931 and 1932, Campbell spent time in California where he befriended John and Carol Steinbeck, and accompanied the marine biologist Ed Ricketts on a trip to Juneau, Alaska. The following year, Campbell took a teaching job at the Canterbury school, while also seeking a full-time position in higher education.</p><p>Campbell accepted a job as a Professor of Literature at Sarah Lawrence College in 1934. Four years later he married the dancer and choreographer, Jean Erdman, who was one of his former students. Campbell published his first book in 1943, a collaboration with Maude Oakes and Jeff King entitled, Where the Two Came to Their Father. Campbell was greatly influenced by the writing of both James Joyce and Thomas Mann, and published books on both authors. A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake (1944) was written with Henry Morton Robinson, and was one of the first major textual analyses of Joyce's Finnegans Wake.</p><title>Where the Two Came to Their Father</title><title>A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake</title><title>Finnegans Wake</title><p>Campbell published a number of books on comparative mythology, which included The Hero with a Thousand Faces (1949); The Mythic Image (1974); the four-volume The Masks of God (1959-1968); the essay collection, The Flight of the Wild Gander; and The Historical Atlas of World Mythology, which was first published in 1983. Campbell had intended to publish four volumes of The Historical Atlas of World Mythology, but only the first volume was completed in his lifetime.</p><title>The Hero with a Thousand Faces</title><title>The Mythic Image</title><title>The Masks of God</title><title>The Flight of the Wild Gander</title><title>The Historical Atlas of World Mythology</title><title>The Historical Atlas of World Mythology</title><p>Throughout his career Campbell collaborated on many writing projects, often as an editor. His most significant editing project was the works of the German scholar, Heinrich Zimmer. After Zimmer's death in 1943, Campbell was tasked with editing and publishing Zimmer's writing. These books include Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization (1946), The King and the Corpse: Tales of the Soul's Conquest of Evil (1948), Philosophies of India (1951), and The Art of Indian Asia (1955). After completing this final volume of Zimmer's work, Campbell took a sabbatical from Sarah Lawrence and made his first trip to Asia, spending the bulk of his time in India and Japan.</p><title>Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization</title><title>The King and the Corpse: Tales of the Soul's Conquest of Evil</title><title>Philosophies of India</title><title>The Art of Indian Asia</title><p>Campbell was also a prolific public speaker and lecturer, and travelled around the country to conferences, workshops, and speaking engagements. Two of his books, Myths to Live By (1972) and The Inner Reaches of Outer Space: Metaphor as Myths and as Religion (1986), are based on his lectures. Campbell spent his career publishing and lecturing, and remained at Sarah Lawrence until his retirement in 1972. That same year he co-founded Theater of the Open Eye in New York City with Jean Erdman. The theater served as a venue for Campbell's lectures, as well as Erdman's dance and theatrical works.</p><title>Myths to Live By</title><title>The Inner Reaches of Outer Space: Metaphor as Myths and as Religion</title><p>Between 1985 and 1987, Campbell recorded a series of conversations with the journalist, Bill Moyers. On October 30, 1987, Campbell died in Honolulu, HI. His conversations with Moyers were broadcast a year later as the television series, The Power of Myth. This television series brought increased attention and recognition to Campbell's work.</p><title>The Power of Myth</title><p>In 1990, the Joseph Campbell Foundation was incorporated in an effort to preserve and promote Campbell's work.</p></biogHist>	Joseph Campbell papers, 1930s-1980s1905-1995  (The New York Public Library.

She was born in Ottawa, Ontario, and began studying piano, harmony, and voice as a child.</p><p>In 1902, at age 17, she travelled to Europe for further study and to launch her career. She trained in Paris under the voice teachers Auguste-Jean Dubulle and Jacques Bouhy. Gauthier performed as a contralto at first, but expanded her range to include the soprano and coloratura registers, though she became known primarily as a mezzo-soprano.</p><p>By 1905, she had toured the United Kingdom and Canada with the famed singer Dame Emma Albani, who publically endorsed Gauther as her successor. She toured Europe as a soloist for a few years before her 1909 opera debut in Pavia, Italy. The following year, Gauthier was scheduled to premiere in Britain with the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden, but was replaced at the last minute. She resigned from the company and never attempted to perform opera again.</p><p>After the Covent Garden incident, Gauthier moved to Java, Indonesia, to live with her future husband, Frans Knoote, with whom she had a son named Evan. She stayed for four years, learning the music of Java and studying with a Gamelan orchestra (Gauthier may have been among the first classically trained western artists to do so). She also toured other countries in the region and performed recitals in China at a time when western classical music was rarely heard there.</p><p>Gauthier left Indonesia for New York when the First World War started. She began performing annually at Aeolian Hall, and a recital there in 1917 proved to be her breakthrough. She sang works of Stravinsky and Ravel, after which Stravinsky chose Gauthier to debut all his concert vocal compositions; she quickly became known for her associations with contemporary composers, who regularly submitted new works for her to perform.</p><p>Through the 1920s, Gauthier toured North America and Europe with a piano accompanist (usually Celius Dougherty), and occasionally performed with orchestras. She became attracted to jazz at that time, and in November 1923, at her annual Aeolian Hall recital, became the first classical musician to perform songs of Irving Berlin, Jerome Kern, and George Gershwin (accompanied by the composer). The program also included music by Schoenberg, Milhaud, Bartok, and Hindemith, and proved to be historic; it directly led to Gershwin's own premiere at Aeolian Hall a few months later, when he debuted his Rhapsody in Blue with the Paul Whiteman Orchestra.</p><p>Gauthier took a hiatus from performance in the late 1920s because of health and financial issues, but resumed her career from 1931 to 1937, after which she retired to concentrate on teaching private students and giving master classes. She maintained a presence in the arts and music scene of New York, attending performances of her students and other vocalists; she was also a founding member of the American Guild of Musical Artists, and served on its board of governors.</p><p>In her final years, Gauthier wrote articles about her life and career for The Musical Record and Musical Courier, and also wrote for radio. She died in New York on December 20, 1958.</p><p>Source: "Éva Gauthier, mezzo-soprano and voice teacher (1885-1958)."

He was the first postmaster of the Town of Clermont, serving variously as a justice of the peace, town supervisor and school supervisor, and a Columbia County judge for the New York State Court of Common Pleas. Wilson was also a founder of professional societies in the fields of medicine and agriculture for Columbia and Dutchess Counties.</p><p>Born in Wooler, Northumberland, England, William Wilson was the son of Reverend Alexander Wilson, minister of the community's Scots (Presbyterian) Church. He graduated from the University of Glasgow in 1775, and succeeded his father as minister in 1778, but soon left the church to study medicine. Upon completion of his studies, he emigrated to New York in 1784, leaving his wife Mary Howey Wilson (1753-1801) and son Alexander (1783-1805) to follow him later. Upon arrival he went directly to Clermont in Columbia County and began the practice of medicine there, implying a connection with the Livingston family. Not long after, he became the estate manager for statesman Robert R. Livingston (1746-1813), known as "the Chancellor," who held Clermont, the "Lower Manor" of the Livingston family. Wilson became a trusted friend and an executor of his legal estate. Wilson knew other members of the Livingston family and acted on their behalf as well, including Edward P. Livingston, who became the proprietor of Clermont upon the death of Robert R. Livingston, his father-in-law, and General Henry Livingston, son of Robert Livingston Jr. (1708-1790).</p><p>William and Mary Wilson's American-born children were sons William H. (William Henry) Wilson (1791-1884), Robert L. (Robert Livingston) Wilson (1794-1830), and U.S. naval captain Stephen B. (Stephen Bayard) Wilson (1795-1863). Their daughters were Frances ("Fanny") Wilson (1787-1879), who married Fyler Dibblee; Elizabeth ("Eliza") Wilson (1797-1879) who married Fyler's brother Richard Dibblee; Mary Ann Wilson (1792-1887), who married George A. Shufeldt; and Alicia Ann ("Nancy" or Ann) Wilson (1799-1888), who married David Van Deusen. After Mary Howey Wilson's death in 1801, William Wilson married Hannah Shufeldt (1784-1876).</p><p>Alexander and Robert both attended Union College and became lawyers, but died at relatively young ages. Robert's law practice in New York City included acting on his father's behalf in local professional and personal legal matters. William H. Wilson studied medicine and served as a surgeon's mate during the War of 1812, but returned to Clermont to help his father in his business and civic affairs. He succeeded his father as postmaster of Clermont in the 1820s, and also sat as a judge for Columbia County in the Court of Common Pleas. Among other civic activities he was a founding trustee of the Claremont Academy, incorporated in 1834. He married Anne Hulme of Philadelphia in 1829 and had two surviving children, Elizabeth Hulme Wilson (1829-1904) and Harold Wilson (1836-1919).</p><p>Robert Livingston Jr. (1708-1790) was the "Third Lord" or proprietor of Livingston Manor in Columbia County, also known as the Upper Manor. The Upper Manor was bordered on the north by the towns of Claverack and Hillsdale, on the west by the Hudson River, north of Clermont and Germantown, and on the east by the border with Massachusetts. Since his son Peter R. Livingston was deeply in debt, he bequeathed the bulk of his land to sons Walter (1733-1797), Robert C. (1742-1794), Henry (1752/3-1823), and John (1750-1822), each receiving one of four "Great Lots," numbered 1-4, respectively. The lots ran east-west through the central and eastern portions of the Upper Manor, with No. 1 bordering Claverack and Hillsdale to the north, and No. 4 bordering Dutchess County to the south. In 1788 the Upper Manor became the Town of Livingston, with the Lower Manor becoming the Town of Claremont.</p><p>The deaths of Robert Livingston Jr. and his sons Walter and Robert in the 1790s had repercussions on Livingston tenant lease-holders and others, especially throughout the great lots. Measures to secure the settlement of the Livingstons' personal estates and their title to land under the 1686 Dongan charter included the surveying of the great lots for farms, collection of back rents from tenants long in arrears and ejections for non-payment of rent, the removal of squatters who cleared farm lands from wood lots, and related legal actions. As a Livingston agent, Wilson was involved in such measures, and assisted in the management of Great Lot No. 2 with Peter Van Schaack. For most of the 1790s he served as a justice of the peace for Clermont.</p><p>Tenants used legal and illegal means to contest the feudal system of landholding. An increasing show of violence came to a head in the mid-1790s, as judicial and legislative interests upheld the Livingstons' titles with strict enforcement of the law. In 1803, Democratic-Republicans in state government succeeded in breaking the Town of Livingston into three townships. Livingston now anchored the area on the Hudson, while the great lots were incorporated into the townships of Granger and Gallatin, later recovering their traditional names of Taghanick and Ancram in 1814 before further subdivision. Robert R. Livingston, aligned with the Democratic-Republican party during the 1790s, switched his allegiance to the Federalists in 1806, not long after his tenure as U.S. Minister to France.</p><p>Although there was further tenant anti-rent unrest, notably in 1811 and the 1840s, the manorial system was already in decline by the time of Wilson's death on December 20, 1828. The transition in landholding patterns was marked by the gradual sale of land by Livingston descendants, and the building of a local civic structure within the context of state and national events.</p><p>Sources:</p><p>Brooke, John L.

Additionally, she is believed to be the first woman to get a taxi license and drive a cab in New York City.</p><p>Born Gertrude Hadley on November 28, 1914, in Urbana, Arkansas, Jeannette met her future husband, Joe Jeannette, a heavyweight boxer 35 years her senior, on prom night. In 1933, they eloped and moved to New York, where she began working as a taxi driver. She also enrolled in shorthand classes at the Abyssinian Baptist Church, where she met Frederick O'Neal, one of the founders of the American Negro Theater. Upon his recommendation, she enrolled in a speech class, held at the Theater, to correct a childhood stammer. Acting was part of the speech therapy curriculum. Since Jeannette had to learn the map of New York City in order to drive a taxi, she realized that she only had to read a script once or twice to know her lines. The American Negro Theater required its students to audition and Jeannette soon became known for her stage presence. She acted alongside such notable figures as Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, and Sidney Poitier. She was cast in her first Broadway production, Lost in the Stars, in 1948. She would subsequently act in other Broadway productions, including The Long Dream (1960), The Amen Corner (1965), and Vieux Carré (1977), among others. She also found roles in film, including Cotton Comes to Harlem (1970) and Shaft (1971).</p><title>Lost in the Stars</title><title>The Long Dream</title><title>The Amen Corner</title><title>Vieux Carré</title><title>Cotton Comes to Harlem</title><title>Shaft</title><p>In response to what she saw as a lack of authentic black characters in the theater, Jeannette began writing plays in 1950; she wrote five plays altogether including The Way Forward (1948-1950); A Bolt from the Blue (1950); Light in the Cellar (1960), a sequel to This Way Forward; Who's Mama's Baby, Who's Daddy's Child (1985); and Gladys' Dilemma (1990). Also around 1950, during the time of the Second Red Scare, the American Negro Theater closed and Jeannette was barred from working because of her association with Paul Robeson, a singer, actor, and political activist (Jeannette's husband was a bodyguard of sorts for Robeson). Instead of heading to Hollywood like many of her acting peers, she took over a space at the Elks Building, calling it the Elks Community Theater. In 1979, she founded another theater company that would be known as the HADLEY (Harlem Artist's Development League Especially for You) Players. In addition to directing many of the Players productions and overseeing its operations, she transformed her two plays, This Way Forward and Light in the Cellar, into a novel, The Secret in the Cellar, which was published in 2006.</p><title>The Way Forward</title><title>A Bolt from the Blue</title><title>Light in the Cellar</title><title>This Way Forward</title><title>Who's Mama's Baby, Who's Daddy's Child</title><title>Gladys' Dilemma</title><title>This Way Forward</title><title>Light in the Cellar</title><title>The Secret in the Cellar</title><p>Jeannette received numerous awards and accolades during her lifetime including the Paul Robeson Award from Actors' Equity.

Also a playwright, her 1982 play, The Brothers, was named one of the twelve outstanding plays of the season by the Theatre Communications Group. In 1982 and 1983, she was a finalist for the Susan Blackburn International Prize for Playwriting. Although only a small amount of her work was published before her death in 1988, she wrote six playscripts, over fifteen short stories, and five screenplays. Some of this material was published in two posthumous publications, her short story collection, Whatever Happened to Interracial Love? (2016), and Notes from a Black Woman's Diary: Selected Works of Kathleen Collins (2019).</p><title>The Cruz Brothers and Miss Malloy</title><title>Losing Ground</title><title>The Brothers</title><title>Whatever Happened to Interracial Love?</title><title>Notes from a Black Woman's Diary: Selected Works of Kathleen Collins</title></biogHist>	Kathleen Collins Scripts collection, 1971-1992 (The New York Public Library.

A practicing dancer since childhood, who was trained in music and percussion, Feldman uses the sound of tap dancing as a musical element within her works. In the mid-1980s she co-invented and patented the Tap Dance Instrument (TDI), a wood and brass multi-timbre floor platform, which is featured in many of her pieces. With her dance company, Anita Feldman Tap, she has performed in over 100 venues, ranging from academic settings to theaters in New York City, around the United States, and in Japan and Germany. Festivals in which she has performed include the Colorado Dance Festival, the Boston Dance Umbrella, and the American Dance Festival. Her collaborators include Lois V. Vierk, Guy Klucevsek, David Bierman, Toby Twining, Larry Polansky, Rhonda Price, Gary Schall, and James Tenney. In the 1980s, Feldman adapted composer Steve Reich's Clapping Music for Tap, performing it as Tapping Music.

Born on March 11, 1909 in Brooklyn, New York, Payne attended Yale College for an undergraduate degree and later Yale Law School. He was admitted to the New York Bar, but didn't have any intention of practicing. In 1941, he accepted a position at Ballet Theatre and was named executive managing director. Payne had a hand in every aspect of the company from coordinating contracts with famous artists and photographers to designing and publishing souvenir programs. Payne's award-winning souvenir programs became a lucrative extension of the company's publicity campaign.</p><p>American Ballet Theatre has been regarded as the preeminent ballet company in the United States. In 1939, Ballet Theatre (as it was known until 1957) grew out of the Mordkin Ballet Company founded by Russian choreographer and dancer Mikhail Mordkin. Ballet Theatre's transition was led by Richard Pleasant and principal dancer Lucia Chase who reorganized the company into a nationally and internationally renowned ballet company. Chase remained dedicated to the repertory and legacy of the American Ballet Theatre until her retirement as company director in 1980 when Mikhail Baryshnikov took over the position. The mission for the formation of the American Ballet Theatre was to create a uniquely American company "which would preserve the best of the classic tradition of Europe and at the same time lay the foundation for a new tradition, American in concept and spirit."</p></biogHist>	Charles Payne collection, 1929-19831940-1974  (The New York Public Library.

Born in Baku, he graduated from the State Conservatory there (where he studied with Kara Kareyev), and from the Leningrad Conservatory. After teaching at the Moscow Conservatory, Felzer returned to Baku, where he became a professor of composition and music theory, and founded and conducted a chamber orchestra. His music was published by the Soviet state publisher, which went out of business after the collapse of the Soviet Union, making much of Felzer's early music unavailable.</p><p>Felzer became a figure of renown in Azerbaijan for being one of the first composers from that republic to employ modernist, avant-garde techniques. He also studied Mugham, the traditional music of Azerbaijan, and incorporated it into his music. His students at Baku Conservatory included Franghiz Ali-Zadeh and Faradzh Karayev (son of Kara), both highly-regarded composers.</p><p>Felzer was declared a dissident in the early 1970s for writing a musical, Woe From Wit, which was critical of the government. It became so popular that the production was halted by the state, and Felzer's salary was frozen and his movements restricted.</p><title>Woe From Wit</title><p>In 1988, after restrictions to travel outside the Soviet Union were relaxed, Felzer obtained a visa and moved to New York City, where he rebuilt his career. He found a job as an accompanist for the Dance Theatre of Harlem, and in 1989, his music was performed at Carnegie Hall's Weill Recital Hall. Later, Felzer was hired as the choirmaster and music tutor at St. Ignatius Church in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. The Continuum ensemble, under Joel Sachs, commissioned Vestige (1993), which won the Stoeger prize of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, and Interrupted Song (Sonata No. 2 for Violin and Piano), Felzer's final work (unfinished, but completed by Faradzh Karayev). Continuum began performing his work in the United States and abroad, as did the Gregg Smith Singers, the Nieuw Ensemble in Amsterdam, and other groups.</p><title>Vestige</title><title>Interrupted Song</title><p>Felzer died of cancer in 1998. In the years after his death, Continuum continued to perform his music and produced first recordings for some pieces. His oeuvre includes solo pieces, piano and organ music, chamber music, works for chamber orchestra, full orchestral compositions, and choral and vocal pieces.</p></biogHist>	Oleg Felzer scores and sound recordings, 1960-1998 (The New York Public Library.

After his schooling, he served in the U.S. Army from 1962 to 1964 as a public information specialist, stationed in Stuttgart, Germany. During his work at radio stations, he became interested in recording technology and the manipulation of tape. Teibel later recounted that he studied electronic music with the German composer Karlheinz Stockhausen during his military service. Following his discharge, Teibel lived in London from 1964 to 1965, and worked in advertising.</p><p>Teibel returned to the United States in 1965 and settled in New York City. He first worked as a freelance photographer and designer, as well as a studio manager for the photographer Bert Stern. Later, he was hired as a photographer and photo editor for Ziff Davis Publications, which published Popular Photography and Car and Driver. His work was featured in both magazines, and he wrote for Popular Photography as well. In his spare time, Teibel continued to study electronic music at the New School.</p><title>Popular Photography</title><title>Car and Driver</title><title>Popular Photography</title><p>In 1968, Teibel was assisting a friend, the filmmaker and musician Tony Conrad, with the soundtrack for his film Coming Attractions by making recordings of the ocean at Coney Island. The experience inspired Teibel to use natural sounds to mask unwanted noise, and he immediately thought of releasing recordings of such "psychoacoustic" sounds commercially. He began creating high-quality field recordings of ocean surf, rainstorms, thunderstorms, country environments, sailing, and other natural sounds. Teibel then partnered with Louis Gerstman, a neuropsychologist who specialized in sound and speech processing, to form a company, Syntonic Research, Inc. to market and distribute the recordings.</p><title>Coming Attractions</title><p>Gerstman assisted Teibel in processing the raw recordings of ocean tides with an IBM 360 computer. After extensive editing, processing, and mixing, the first long-playing record in the Environments series, Psychologically Ultimate Seashore, was released in late 1969. Teibel designed the LP album covers, took his own photographs, and wrote the liner notes.</p><title>Environments</title><title>Psychologically Ultimate Seashore</title><p>The series was an immediate success, and subsequent issues were distributed through Atlantic Records. These included Optimum Aviary, Dawn At New Hope, Ultimate Thunderstorms, Wind In The Trees, A Country Stream, and English Meadow, among others. A total of 22 albums were released in the series over a period of 10 years. For much of this time, Teibel worked out of an office on the top floor of the Flatiron building. Syntonic Research also released an album of the keyboardist Raymond Erickson performing Renaissance, Baroque, and Classical piano works on synthesizer and harpsichord, as well as a re-publication of an 1895 reference book, The Complete Compendium of Universal Knowledge.</p><title>Optimum Aviary</title><title>Dawn At New Hope</title><title>Ultimate Thunderstorms</title><title>Wind In The Trees</title><title>A Country Stream</title><title>English Meadow</title><title>The Complete Compendium of Universal Knowledge</title><p>In addition to his work with Syntonic Research, Teibel created an environmental sound installation for the Museum of Contemporary Crafts (1970), and taught a class in experimental recording techniques at the New School (1971). In 1973, Teibel edited a recording of Richard Nixon's August 15th "Second Watergate" speech to make it sound as if Nixon was admitting to having prior knowledge of the Watergate break-in of 1972. "The Altered Nixon Speech" was a hit single and boosted Teibel's reputation as a specialist in magnetic tape technology. He was later called as an expert witness in high-profile criminal proceedings.</p><p>In 1981, Teibel moved with his wife to Austin, Texas, where they raised two daughters, and where he continued to run Syntonic Research from his home.

Baldwin had a difficult time finishing the screenplay, so Worth hired Arnold Perl to assist; the two completed a 250-page manuscript which was not viewed favorably by Columbia Pictures. Baldwin left the project, and it was sold to Warner Brothers. A few years later, Baldwin published his script and Perl produced a documentary. Other drafts were written by such notable writers as Calder Willingham, Hakim A. Jamal, and Joseph A. Walker. The film was not completed, however, until 1992 when Spike Lee adapted the Baldwin and Perl script.</p></biogHist>	Collection of screenplays on Malcolm X, 1968-1975 (The New York Public Library.

As a teenager, she participated in school musical performances and the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in the summer of 1964. In 1973, she looked up "tap dance" in the Boston yellow pages, found her way to the dance studio of Stanley Brown, and began to study tap dance. One year later, she moved to New York City where she studied dance with the Judson Dance Theatre experimentalist Simone Forti. Lessons with Charles "Cookie" Cook, Albert "Gip" Gibson, Leon Collins, and Leslie "Bubba" Gaines soon followed. After about six months of studying the craft, she decided instead to write about tap dance. She traveled to Pittsburgh to interview Paul Draper and published her first article, "It's All in the Feet" in Boston's Patriot Ledger in 1974.</p><p>Five years later, in 1979, Goldberg formally founded the Changing Times Tap Dance Company, dedicated to preserving, promoting, and creating new tap performances. The company was also dedicated to the mixing of dancers who were young and old, black and white, and male and female. Within the auspices of the company, Goldberg generated many more ideas that would help bring a more enthusiastic, critical, and public response to tap dance, thus fueling the flames of its renaissance.</p><p>Teaching the rhythm tap tradition also became part of Goldberg's charge. She knew its survival required it to be passed on by the masters of tap. In 1980, Changing Times Tap Company produced By Word of Foot: Tap Masters Pass on Their Tradition at the Village Gate in New York City. It was a rare gathering of tap's leading dancers, where they discussed their traditions and taught their own evolved styles. By Word of Foot was hailed as the first tap festival, and was organized and produced again in 1982 and 1985.</p><p>In the 1990s, Goldberg continued her exploration of comedy, tapping, and talking with productions such as Tapping and Talking Dirty, Rhythm and Schmooze, and The Rhythm Method. Jane continues to travel with The Traveling Tap Museum, a mobile exhibition and set for presentations about tap dancing. She also delivers Tap-A-Grams™, a singing/tapping telegram service. Her team of dancers will dance and sing for a special event or occasion on request.</p></biogHist>	Changing Times Tap Dancing Company collection, 1943-20171970-2010  (The New York Public Library.

Born in Cincinnati, she graduated at her parents' urging with a degree in home economics from the Carnegie Institute of Technology (later Carnegie Mellon University). Button decided instead that she wanted to learn costume design, and taught herself to draw, earning a scholarship at the Yale School of Drama.</p><p>She launched her career in 1967 with her designs for Macbird!, an Off-Broadway production which earned her the Henry Hewes Design Award from the American Theater Wing.

Button worked with theater companies around the country, including The Acting Company, Yale Repertory Theatre, Roundabout Theatre, Great Lakes Theatre Festival, Alley Theatre (Houston), and the American Shakespeare Festival. Button also designed for opera (La Bohème and The Ring), and ballet, including Trey McIntyre's productions of Aliss In Wonderland and Peter Pan for the Houston Ballet in the early 2000s.</p><title>The Watering Place</title><title>Henry V</title><title>The Robber Bridegroom</title><title>Wings</title><title>Richard III</title><title>Arsenic and Old Lace</title><title>The Twilight of the Golds</title><title>La Bohème</title><title>The Ring</title><title>Aliss In Wonderland</title><title>Peter Pan</title><p>In later years, Button was a professor of costume design at Tulane University in New Orleans.</p><p>Button married Stephen Sbarge, a playwright she met at Yale, but the couple divorced; they had a son named Raphael, who became an actor. Her second husband, MacDonald Eaton (1929-2013), whom she married in 1981, was a production designer and painter. After receiving his B.F.A. in drama from the Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1952, he served in the U.S. Army Pictoral Center before he began designing for Off-Broadway productions. From the mid-1950s to 1962, Eaton worked at ABC as a production designer before moving to CBS. He returned to ABC in 1975 to be the scenic artist for the soap opera One Life To Live, a job he held for 15 years. During this time he was an active painter and exhibited his work in group shows, as well as in three one-man shows. Eaton moved to New Orleans with Jeanne Button and was an adjunct professor of production design and scenic art at Tulane University.

Authors, Nigerian#Political activists#Short stories, African (English)		Dramatists		<biogHist><p>Obi Egbuna was a Nigerian novelist, short-story writer, and political activist. He was born in Nigeria in 1938. In 1961, he moved to England to study law. His first novel, Wind Versus Polygamy (1964), was developed into a play and chosen to represent Britain at the First World Black Festival of Arts held in Dakar, Senegal, in 1966. The play was then featured on BBC Radio and Television and repeated on the series, "Seven Selected Plays" where it was read by actress Peggy Ashcroft. BBC critic and producer James Mactaggart referred to Egbuna as "Africa's Gogol". Egbuna also became associated with controversy upon the publication of Wind Versus Polygamy. Critics were polarized by Egbuna's discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of polygamy.</p><title>Wind Versus Polygamy</title><title>Wind Versus Polygamy</title><p>Around the same time, Egbuna joined the Universal Colored People's Association (UCPA), an arm of the British Black Power movement, which marked his foray into the world of political activism. In the late 1960s, he visited the United States and met American leaders of the Black Power movement, including Elijah Mohammed, the leader of the Nation of Islam. Egbuna would soon become a leading figure in the movement in England. During this time of political activism, he was writing short stories, including Daughters of the Sun and Other Stories (1970); plays, such as The Anthill (1965); and articles for The Sunday Times, The New Statesman, and Africa and the World. Additionally, he was the editor of The Voice of Africa, a journal devoted to the Pan-African philosophy of Kwame Nkrumah, the former president of Ghana. In 1968, Egbuna wrote The Murder of Nigeria: An Indictment, which condemned the Ibo-Biafran War that left one million Nigerians dead. Like Nkrumah, he realized that a political program for Africans in the diaspora that ignored the African continent was useless.</p><title>Daughters of the Sun and Other Stories</title><title>The Anthill</title><title>The Sunday Times</title><title>The New Statesman</title><title>Africa and the World</title><title>The Voice of Africa</title><title>The Murder of Nigeria: An Indictment</title><p>In 1970, Egbuna was arrested for conspiring to kill police officers and held without bail for six months. While in prison, he wrote Destroy This Temple: The Voice of Black Power in Britain (1971), which discusses the horrors of slavery and the Ibo-Biafran War. At his trial, he was found guilty but given a suspended sentence.</p><title>Destroy This Temple: The Voice of Black Power in Britain</title><p>After Egbuna's release from prison, around 1972, he returned to Nigeria where he became a director for state television and the director of the Writer's Workshop. He also continued writing, focusing on his observations of black culture in Britain and the United States in such publications as The ABC of Black Power Thought (1973), which was dedicated to Nkrumah, and Diary of a Homeless Prodigal (1976). He also published his second novel, The Minister's Daughter (1975) and another book of stories, The Emperor of the Sea and Other Stories (1976). The novel takes on a satirical tone in discussing corrupt elite factions and coups, while the stories examine polygamy and the poor living conditions of Africans in colonial Africa.</p><title>The ABC of Black Power Thought</title><title>Diary of a Homeless Prodigal</title><title>The Minister's Daughter</title><title>The Emperor of the Sea and Other Stories</title><p>In 1976, Egbuna moved to the United States to attend the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa, where he was named Fellow in Writing and received his master's degree. He completed his doctorate degree at Howard University in 1986, where he also taught and lectured from 1980–1986. While at Howard, he was influenced by individuals such as Julian Mayfield, Sterling Brown, and Eugenia Collier.

According to his resume, his earliest education, from 1966-1971, was devoted to the study of reliure d'art (bookbinding) with Gerard Charriere at the Newberry Library of Chicago. He also spent a year at Loop College in Chicago, from 1966-1967, and a year at DePaul University, from 1968-1969. From 1974-1978, he studied in New York at Manhattan Community College, the Center for Book Arts, and the School of Visual Arts.</p><p>Walker's work and exhibition history are mostly derived from his papers as well. In 1971, Walker worked in Special Collections at the New York Public Library, where he inventoried and catalogued rare books and works on paper; this position possibly helped to inform his work. In 1978, he was awarded a National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) Master Craftsmen Educational grant through the Center for Book Arts. This grant allowed him to research ancient Coptic book forms for his artwork. Around the same time, one of his pieces, Spaces, was included in an exhibition at the Grolier Club. Beginning around 1980, in order to pursue his artwork, he mainly supported himself as a computer technician in various temporary positions. His Coptic book, Modern Relics, completed using the research he obtained from the NEA grant, was included in the Dialects exhibition at Franklin Furnace Gallery in 1980. Walker's work was purchased by the Ruth and Marvin Sackner Archive of Concrete and Visual Poetry in 1983 and 1985. In 1983-1984, his work was included in the 4th Annual Book Show at Kathryn Markel Gallery and the Footworks exhibition at Public Image Gallery. The Magical Properties of Sunflowers, a work which used Coptic binding, acrylics, colored pencil, stencils, rubber, and brass stamps, was included in the exhibition, The First Decade: Center for Book Arts, held at the New York Public Library in 1984. This work is also featured in the exhibition catalog of the same name. The Spencer Collection of the New York Public Library purchased his work, Mumbo Jumbo, in 1985. Also in 1985, he participated in exhibitions at the Hand In Hand Galleries and the Center for Book Arts. Additionally, he created sketchbooks for other artists such as Brice Marden, James Brown, and Huck Snyder. His work was exhibited at additional galleries such as Gallery Nature Morte and Civilian Warfare Studio.</p><title>Spaces</title><title>Modern Relics</title><title>Dialects</title><title>The Magical Properties of Sunflowers</title><title>The First Decade: Center for Book Arts</title><title>Mumbo Jumbo</title><p>Walker died in the late 1980s. He remains an elusive figure. The scarce information available mainly comes from this collection and Vince Aletti, who donated this collection and let Walker live in his guest room in the East Village for a brief time in the mid-1970s. Peter Hujar, a photographer who also lived in the area, often photographed his friends and neighbors, one of whom was Reggie Walker. Although Aletti and Walker lived together, they were not the closest of friends, and at times, according to Aletti, they barely spoke. Aletti describes Hujar's Reggie Walker (1976), which is housed at the Princeton University Art Museum, as a reminder of why Aletti invited Walker to stay with him; "Reggie was funny, quick, and intense and had great style. I don't remember that pistol pendant he's wearing; it seems so unlike him.

James Miller McKim's children Lucy McKim (1842-1877) and the architect Charles Follen McKim (1847-1909) were thus Ellen's first cousins. Lucy McKim married Wendell P. Garrison (1840-1907), the son of abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison (1805-1879). Sarah Yardley Beers claimed her D.A.R. membership through the service of Catherine Miller's father Jeremiah Miller (died 1817). The father of Miller's son-in-law, a Northern Irish emigrant and farmer also named James McKim, served on the Pennsylvania frontier during the Revolution.</p><p>Samuel P. Mulvany was buried at Barren Hill on July 25, 1858. After her father's death, Ellen Mulvany lived with various McKim, Miller and Mulvany relatives. She attended the Millersville State Normal School in Pennsylvania in the early 1860s, taught school, and married William Buckman Yardley on March 31, 1870. Their wedding took place at the James Miller McKim residence in Llewellyn Park, West Orange, New Jersey. In 1886 she married Edwin Ruthven Armstrong of Ireland (1846-1921), a Protestant Episcopal minister who retired from Trinity Church in Sharon Springs, New York. She signed her married name as Ellen M. Yardley and later Ellen M. Armstrong. Her middle initial M may refer to Mulvany rather than McKim; the name Mulvany is sometimes spelled Mulvaney in family records.</p><p>John L. M. (John Linn McKim) Yardley (1882-1960), Sarah's brother, was an engineer. He held degrees from Princeton University and the University of Pennsylvania, and served as a captain in the U.S. Army during World War I. He married Euphemia Baggaley (1897-1949) and they had two sons, Ralph B. Yardley (1918-1995) and John Linn McKim Yardley, Jr. (1928-2016). He married, second, Margaret Daye Fell in 1951.</p></biogHist>	Sarah Yardley Beers family papers, 1807-1983 (The New York Public Library.

Henley killed Corll in self-defense on August 8, 1973, and contacted the police that day.

Born in Newark, New Jersey, and raised in Irvington, Applebaum began playing piano at the age of 7. His first influences were jazz pianists such as Art Tatum and Oscar Peterson, and he wrote his first compositions and arrangements at age 12. By the time he was 19, Applebaum was writing for several big band leaders, including Cootie Williams, Benny Goodman, Harry James, and Glenn Miller. Applebaum never had a composition teacher growing up, but later studied with Stefan Wolpe.</p><p>In 1941, he was drafted and served three years in the military, where he conducted and arranged for the United States Army Band in Germany. After World War II, Applebaum moved to New York City, where he worked as a staff arranger for CBS and NBC, and continued to write arrangements for band leaders such as Raymond Scott and Charlie Ventura. He also began collaborating with the conductor Andre Kostelanetz. Though he worked primarily as an arranger, Applebaum co-wrote the song "Passing Strangers," a hit recording of which was made by Billy Eckstine and Sarah Vaughan in 1957.</p><p>In the late 1950s and 1960s, Applebaum worked with the producers, composers, lyricists, and singers associated with the Brill Building, including Ben E. King, Jerry Lieber, Mike Stoller, Neil Sedaka, the Drifters, the Coasters, Carole King, and Gerry Goffin. Applebaum was particularly noted for his arrangement for Ben E. King's hit for the Drifters, "Stand By Me," as well as "Save The Last Dance For Me" and "This Magic Moment." Other artists with whom he worked included Harold Arlen, Bobby Vinton, Ella Fitzgerald, Della Reese, Brook Benton, Quincy Jones, Doc Pomus, and Connie Francis. Applebaum had a hand in 35 top ten hits, as well as several number-one singles. He also released a hit album of his own, Hollywood's Bad But Beautiful Girls (1963).</p><title>Hollywood's Bad But Beautiful Girls</title><p>For 15 years, Applebaum was the main arranger and orchestrator for Skitch Henderson and the New York Pops Orchestra, and he also worked with the New York and London Philharmonic orchestras. In 1986, he produced the orchestrations for the Broadway musical Raggedy Ann. Applebaum was very successful in the commercial world, and founded his own company, S.A. Productions, to write and produce music for radio and television commercials. One of them, "Makes The Going Great," for Pan Am airlines, was turned into a ballet by George Balanchine. He also published compositions and arrangements for concert bands and orchestras, some written for student ensembles; piano etude books; and texts on harmony and composition.</p><title>Raggedy Ann</title></biogHist>	Stan Applebaum papers, 1940-2007 (The New York Public Library.

Africa.#Augusta, GA#Ghana.	African American clergy.		<biogHist><p>Reverend Dr. Richard Eugene Stenhouse, Sr. was born January 17, 1921 in Greenville, South Carolina to Luther and Fannie E. Stenhouse, the youngest of four brothers and three sisters. Enriched by a strong church environment, it was the family's general consensus that he would become a minister. During the course of his life, his actions were as a man of faith and a seeker of justice. Specifically, he spent a lifetime reclaiming his humanity and those of his fellow U.S. residents by advocating for social, economic, and political parity. Faced with a nation that legalized racism, justified through violence, subordination, and oppression, Stenhouse demonstrated great resolve and commitment to disrupt, overturn, and resist systemic issues of injustice. This work was personal as well as professional. It was also done in collaboration with others across racial lines and was aligned with the principles of nonviolence and peace. In addition, his wife, Ella V. Griffin Stenhouse, whom he married in 1957, was a supporter, ally, and partner in all of his endeavors.</p><p>A 1937 graduate of Sterling High School in his hometown, Stenhouse earned his bachelor's degree in 1949 at William Penn College in Oskaloosa, Iowa. Prior to attending college, he had registered as a conscientious objector and during World War II he was conscripted to serve three years (1940-1943) in the Civilian Public Service Camps (CPS), however the period of conscription in the CPS camps was later extended until the last of the soldiers returned from overseas in 1947. Finding his conscription in the CPS camps a contradiction to his convictions, Stenhouse went AWOL (absent without leave) from the California camp where he was working and enrolled in William Penn College. After completing his studies there, he attended Haverford College in Pennsylvania in pursuit of a master's degree in philosophy, which he earned in 1950. His thesis was entitled "The Mysticism of Isaac Pennington," an important Quaker leader. During his years in the CPS he became a member of the Wider Quaker Fellowship, thus, while earning his degree, he resided at the Quaker Center for Social and Religious Studies in Pendle Hill. Although he was a Presbyterian minister, his relationship with the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) would be life-long. This connection included shared protests around social issues, particularly those regarding race and racism.</p><p>Stenhouse began his formal training for the ministry at Union Theological Seminary in New York City upon completion of his studies at Haverford. During this period he served at the Presbyterian Church of the Master. A member of an interracial ministerial staff, he was director of a racially integrated summer camp program sponsored by the Church and Morningside Community Center. In 1953, after earning his master's of divinity in systematic theology and ordination in the United Presbyterian Church U.S.A., he served as first Assistant and then Associate Pastor of the Presbyterian Church of the Master until 1958. Shortly afterwards, Stenhouse accepted a teaching position at Paine College in Augusta, GA where he taught religion and philosophy for 2 years, and in 1963 he became the Dean of Students/Dean of Student Affairs until 1971. At the same time he pursued a Ph.D. in philosophy of religion from the University of Denver, Colorado. His dissertation, "Current Status of Chief Student Personnel Administrators in United Negro College Fund Member Institutions," provided a description and analysis of the status of the chief student personnel administrations in relation to current and future professional trends in the administration of these services.</p><p>A pacifist and supporter of nonviolence as a means of advancing social change, Stenhouse participated in sit-ins at a local Woolworth store and in several area churches in Augusta challenging the persistent laws of racial segregation. A student of the nonviolent philosophies of Mahatma Gandi and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., he gave his students at Paine College a thorough introduction to the philosophy and practice of nonviolence in the resolution of social conflict. As a result of his teachings and leadership, the students played a vital and substantial role in striving to maintain racial harmony and peace in Augusta during the racial disturbances of the 1960s. Also during this period, under Mrs. Stenhouse's leadership, a core of parents opened the community's first interracial kindergarten, Open Door, which is still in operation as of 2011.</p><p>In 1970, Dr. Chester Marcus, the Associate Regional Secretary for Africa in the United Church of Christ's United Church Board for World Ministries (UCBWM) in New York, invited Stenhouse to consider a mission to Africa. Stenhouse accepted the offer and in 1971, he and his wife, Ella, a licensed practical nurse and certified teacher, went to Ghana to serve as UCBWM missionaries for six years. They were assigned to the Evangelical Presbyterian Church Seminary in Peki Blengo where Stenhouse began his work serving in the Evangelical school as a teacher. A year later he became principal of the school after the then principal, Dr. Reverend C. K. Dovlo, was promoted to Moderator of the Church and relocated to Ho, Ghana. Among other things, Stenhouse used his position to work for the inclusion of women in the Seminary and encourage self-reliance for his African pupils, which was not wholeheartedly embraced by his white U.S. colleagues and other missionaries working in Africa. Because there were very few individuals of African descent from the U.S. involved as missionaries or in leadership roles within the UCBWM, Stenhouse often found himself functioning as a buffer, mediator, and advocate in direct response to the conservative views and actions taken by missionaries and colleagues.</p><p>In 1977, Stenhouse became the Associate Regional Secretary for Africa under Dr. Marcus and moved back to New York to the UCBWM offices. He was named Acting Regional Secretary in 1979 after Marcus had a stroke, and officially assumed the position of Regional Secretary of Africa two years later. As Regional Secretary, Stenhouse was responsible for coordinating the work of over thirty missionaries in ten African nations (Ghana, Togo, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Mozambique, Botswana, Angola, Lesotho, and Namibia). In this capacity, he maintained oversight of the regional budget, programs, and relationships tied to the Africa office, one of 6 regions (Africa, East Asia, Southern Asia, Europe, Latin America/Caribbean/Oceania, and Middle East) served by the UCBWM. As part of his duties he made numerous trips to visit the missionaries and churches in the countries within his region between 1979-1984. He also attended the independence celebration of Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia) from British rule in 1980 and visited other countries (Kenya, Swaziland, and Zaire) in addition to those within his region.</p><p>In 1984, Stenhouse took a leave of absence from his position as African Regional Secretary for personal and family reasons. However, his commitment to increase the number of black and other minority missionaries resulted in his becoming a UCBWM consultant for the UCC Black Constituency and the Council of Racial and Ethnic Ministries (COREM), two internal organizations that were, in part, charged with building participation of underrepresented groups in the missionary corps. He was replaced by an interim Regional Secretary, and when he did not return to that position Andrea Young was hired to fill the position permanently in 1985.</p><p>Within a month of assuming the consultancy, Stenhouse proposed a new position that expanded the liaison role that he was fulfilling between the United Black Christians and UCC to incorporate other racial/ethnic groups. The proposed position would increase the interest, participation, and assignment of qualified members of racial and ethnic groups in UCBWM overseas mission and service programs. Although the goals for the position were broadly multiracial/multiethnic in intention, efforts to increase the commitment of Christians of African descent to overseas ministries were fore-grounded.</p><p>Stenhouse's decision to broaden the scope of the consultancy appears to have been the result of ongoing conversations among the UCC's racial and ethnic organizations regarding the lack of diversity among UCBWM personnel, as well as the perception that these groups were not treated as equals within the organization, and that limited communication contributed to the entrenched underrepresentation of missionaries. Stenhouse's proposal called for an executive position within the UCBWM, thus centralizing the recruitment efforts of blacks and the other constituent minority groups/organizations. Specific goals entailed increasing personal contact between UCBWM and the various underrepresented groups via outreach and recruitment, and evaluating and securing feedback from constituent groups on their awareness of overseas missions and their overall perceptions of UCBWM. As described by an internal memo, Stenhouse's new role would "develop[ing] a new program of relationships within the UCC in the USA." A news article further described the new initiative as "developing an integrated global mission." Although Stenhouse held the consultancy for a little over a year, his recruitment efforts established and confirmed the inconsistencies between UCBWM policies and practices internally and overseas through surveys and feedback that he obtained. His proposal and subsequent role ultimately served to facilitate the initial phase of an initiative to improve the role and image of the UCBWM in the view of minority constituents. In addition to carrying out the formal goals, Stenhouse advocated policy changes, among them that the consultant position be included in the UCC/UCBWM budget and that it be a permanent position.</p><p>During his time as a consultant, Stenhouse remained attentive to issues in Africa. In particular, he participated in a planned apartheid protest demonstration at the South Africa embassy in Washington, DC. in 1985, where he was arrested. The issue of apartheid was persistently discussed among his colleagues and Stenhouse was outspoken on the issue of U.S. government and corporate divestiture.</p><p>Stenhouse retired in 1985. In 1987 he suffered a stroke and died in 1993. He was survived by his wife, Ella and three children, Richard, Jr., David and Vera.</p></biogHist>	Richard E.

Jean Babette Stein was born on February 9th, 1934 in Chicago, Illinois to Jules C. Stein and Doris Jones Stein. Her father, Jules Stein, co-founded the music booking agency Music Corporation of America (MCA) with William R. Goodheart, Jr. in 1929. This company, which initially pioneered the system of musicians touring America, would branch out into radio and open offices in New York, before eventually landing in Hollywood in 1937, at the recommendation of Stein's partner Lew Wasserman. Now known simply as MCA, it became one of the leading talent agencies in the country, representing such stars as Bette Davis, Betty Grable, Joan Crawford, Greta Garbo, Eddie Cantor, Ingrid Bergman, Frank Sinatra, and Jack Benny.</p><p>As the daughter of such a prominent film industry figure, Jean Stein grew up in an atmosphere of fame, wealth, and movie stars. Many of her father's famous clients were frequent guests at Misty Mountain, the family's Beverly Hills estate, and Stein played with the children of movie stars and moguls throughout her childhood.</p><p>Stein studied at both Wellesley College and the Sorbonne, in Paris, France. Much of her early 20s were spent living abroad in Paris, Rome, Venice, and other European cities, as well as in New York, where she worked as assistant to director Elia Kazan on the original production of Tennessee Williams's Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1955). In 1954, while visiting St. Moritz, nineteen year old Stein met the legendary American novelist William Faulkner and they began a love affair. Faulkner was then fifty-six and married, but the affair continued until Stein met the man who would become her first husband, William vanden Heuvel. During their relationship, Stein persuaded the usually reticent Faulkner to allow her to interview him. The interview was subsequently published in The Paris Review in 1956, and Stein became an editor there, working for George Plimpton.</p><title>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</title><title>The Paris Review</title><p>Stein moved back to New York City to work at Esquire, as an assistant to features editor Clay Felker. In 1958, Stein married lawyer and diplomat William vanden Heuvel, whose position as special assistant to Robert Kennedy, during the latter's tenure as United States Attorney General put Stein in Kennedy's circle and inspired her first book. Stein and vanden Heuvel were among the group that traveled with Kennedy's body from New York to Washington after his assassination in 1968. This trip was the subject of American Journey: The Times of Robert Kennedy (1970), which was edited by George Plimpton.</p><title>Esquire</title><title>American Journey: The Times of Robert Kennedy</title><p>Living in New York during the 1960s, Stein was part of the world of the artistic, intellectual, political, and literary intelligentsia. Among her friends was Andy Warhol muse Edie Sedgwick, and Stein considered her the perfect symbol for the 1960s. Sedgwick's tragic life, and her journey from socialite to superstar to death at age 28 by drug overdose would be the subject of Stein's next oral history, Edie: An American Biography (1982) (reprinted in 1994 as Edie: American Girl). The text was composed entirely of interviews Stein conducted with friends, colleagues and family of Sedgwick, and was also edited by George Plimpton.

Petry's father was a pharmacist who owned drugstores in Old Saybrook and nearby Old Lyme and her mother was a chiropodist and entrepreneur. Petry was the youngest of two girls. Her older sister's name was Helen Lane (later Bush after marriage). Petry hailed from four generations of African Americans living in the predominantly white, middle class town of Old Saybrook. Stories of her ancestors' hardships in New England planted the creative seeds of inspiration that would eventually become central to her writings. Petry began penning short stories and one-act plays while in high school. However, much of her time was spent working at the family pharmacy. Upon graduating high school, she briefly attended Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute in Hampton, VA where she studied Home Economics. This area of study was not to her liking. So, in keeping with family tradition (in addition to her father, Petry's aunt, Anna Louise James, was also a pharmacist), she decided to become a pharmacist. She attended the Connecticut College of Pharmacy and earned a graduate degree in 1931.</p><p>For the next few years, she worked as a pharmacist at the family drugstore while continuing to write short stories in her spare time. In 1938, Ann married George David Petry and moved to New York City to pursue her literary ambitions of becoming a writer. Throughout their time in New York, they lived on Edgecombe Ave., on East 129th St., and eventually in a leftist housing complex in the Bronx, and potentially other locations. While living in New York City, Petry visited a numerologist who told her that she would never be successful unless she dropped the extra "a" from her first name. Thus, Anna became Ann.</p><p>Petry's decade in Harlem was rich, dense, productive, and successful. Upon her arrival in Harlem, she soon found work selling advertising space for the Amsterdam News, a weekly Harlem publication. She then became a reporter for a weekly paper published by Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. called, the People's Voice. Petry contributed a women's column called "The Lighter Side" which covered social events and news stories. She taught for the NAACP and at PS 101. Petry was also involved in the arts as an actress. Her debut performance was at the American Negro Theater in a comedy called, On Striver's Row, written by Abram Hill. She also took drawing classes at the Harlem Art Center and her husband, George, took weaving classes. She was co-founder of Negro Women Incorporated along with Dollie Lowther Robinson. Negro Women Incorporated was a women's advocacy group that sought to "help women get their money's worth" and was affiliated with the People's Committee, founded by Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.</p><title>Amsterdam News</title><title>People's Voice</title><title>On Striver's Row</title><p>To assist in her literary pursuits, Petry enrolled in Mabel Louise Robinson's writing class at Columbia University. Her first short fiction, a romance-suspense piece titled, "Marie of the Cabin Club", was published in 1939 in The Afro American under male pseudonym, Arnold Petri. From 1938 until 1944, Petry wrote numerous short stories for literary journals. The initial chapters of The Street won Petry the 1945 Houghton Mifflin Literary Fellowship, which served as a turning point in her career. The Street tells the story of protagonist, Lutie Johnson, a single mother trying to provide a better life for her son than could realistically be had amidst the poverty of West 116th St. in Harlem. The book was an instant hit, selling a million and a half copies. It received numerous, positive reviews, being favorably compared with Richard Wright's Native Son, and was widely published and translated into French, Spanish, Japanese, and Portuguese. Country Place, Petry's second novel, was published the following year in 1947.</p><title>The Afro American</title><title>The Street</title><title>The Street</title><title>Native Son</title><title>Country Place</title><p>Ultimately, the success of The Street made Petry a much sought-after but reluctant interview subject and speaker, who would inevitably, if futilely, strive for a secluded writing life in Connecticut. In 1948, after becoming an established writer, Petry and her husband moved back to Old Saybrook. Petry gave birth to her only child, Elisabeth (Liz) Ann Petry, on January 28, 1949. As a departure from her novels, Petry's first foray into the world of children's books also occurred in 1949 with the publication of Drugstore Cat. Petry's subsequent publications include her third novel, The Narrows, published in 1953; Harriet Tubman: Conductor of the Underground Railroad, published in 1955; Tituba of Salem Village, published in 1964; Legends of the Saints, in 1970; and a book of short stories titled Miss Muriel and Other Stories, published in 1971.</p><title>The Street</title><title>Drugstore Cat</title><title>The Narrows</title><title>Harriet Tubman: Conductor of the Underground Railroad</title><title>Tituba of Salem Village</title><title>Legends of the Saints</title><title>Miss Muriel and Other Stories</title><p>From 1973-1975, Petry briefly moved to Hawaii to serve as a Visiting Professor in the English Department at the University of Hawaii. When she returned to Old Saybrook, much of her time was divided between writing, parenting, and providing care and assistance to other ailing family members. Petry passed away on April 28, 1997.</p></biogHist>	Ann Petry papers, 1920-2012 (The New York Public Library.

Swados helped him find work and make connections in the theater world, and Friedman moved to New York after his graduation. Swados also hired Friedman as music director for two projects, her piece Cantata 2000 (1997) and her music for a production of Brecht's The Caucasian Chalk Circle (1998).</p><title>Cantata 2000</title><title>The Caucasian Chalk Circle</title><p>Friedman met the writer-director Steve Cosson, a frequent collaborator, in the late-1990s, and in 2001 the two were among the founding members of the theatrical troupe The Civilians, which became the home for many Friedman works.

She was born on March 18, 1942, in Jersey City, New Jersey. She attended Skidmore College, where she was introduced to activism upon joining the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC); as a member of SNCC, she worked on black southern voter registration. After receiving her bachelor's degree, she earned a master's degree in French literature and cinema at the Middlebury College program at Paris's Sorbonne. From 1967-1974, Collins worked as a film editor for various organizations, including the BBC, Craven Films, and William Greaves Productions, among others. She taught in the Theatre Arts Department of City College in New York City from 1974 until her death in 1988.</p><p>Collins was the first African American woman to write, direct, and produce a full-length feature film (The Cruz Brothers and Miss. Malloy, 1980, which was based on a Henry Roth novel). Her second feature film, Losing Ground (1982), which she directed and coproduced, was based on her original screenplay; it received international acclaim. Also a playwright, her 1982 play, The Brothers, was named one of the twelve outstanding plays of the season by the Theatre Communications Group. In 1982 and 1983, she was a finalist for the Susan Blackburn International Prize for Playwriting. Although only a small amount of her work was published before her death in 1988, she wrote six playscripts, over fifteen short stories, and five screenplays. Some of this material was published in two posthumous publications, her short story collection, Whatever Happened to Interracial Love? (2016), and Notes from a Black Woman's Diary: Selected Works of Kathleen Collins (2019). These publications not only exemplify the breadth of her talent but have introduced her work to a wider audience.</p><title>The Cruz Brothers and Miss.

The last ballerina to have fully trained and developed under Balanchine, she now advises companies and dancers staging his ballets around the world.</p><p>Ashley was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, and raised in Rutland, Vermont, where she began her ballet studies at the age of seven. In 1964, at the age of thirteen, she was awarded a scholarship to continue her training at the School of American Ballet as part of its Ford Foundation Scholarship program.</p><p>In 1967, George Balanchine invited Ashley to join the corps de ballet of the New York City Ballet, where she soon appeared in both corps and soloist roles in almost all of the ballets in the Company's repertory. In 1974, she was promoted to the rank of soloist, and three years later she became a principal dancer. Ashley danced her final performance with the Company as part of the Opening Night Benefit on November 25, 1997.</p><p>Balanchine choreographed both Ballo della Regina and Ballade for Ashley, and she also originated roles in Jerome Robbins' Concertino and Brahms/Handel, which he choreographed with Twyla Tharp. Her repertory included roles in ballets as diverse as Balanchine's Concerto Barocco, Firebird, The Nutcracker (as both the Dewdrop and Sugarplum Fairy), Prodigal Son (as the Siren), Serenade, Square Dance, Stars and Stripes, Swan Lake, and Tchaikovsky Suite No. 3 (in "Theme and Variations"), as well as Robbins' Dances at a Gathering. During the New York City Ballet's 1988 American Music Festival, she originated a principal role in Peter Martins' Barber Violin Concerto. She also originated principal roles in Martins' Fearful Symmetries in 1990 and The Sleeping Beauty (as Carabosse) in 1991.</p><title>Ballo della Regina</title><title>Ballade</title><title>Concertino</title><title>Brahms/Handel</title><title>Concerto Barocco</title><title>Firebird</title><title>The Nutcracker</title><title>Prodigal Son</title><title>Serenade</title><title>Square Dance</title><title>Stars and Stripes</title><title>Swan Lake</title><title>Tchaikovsky Suite No. 3</title><title>Dances at a Gathering</title><title>Barber Violin Concerto</title><title>Fearful Symmetries</title><title>The Sleeping Beauty</title><p>Ashley danced throughout the world, including the major capitals of Western and Eastern Europe, and in China. In 1978, she danced at The White House for President and Mrs. Carter, and in 1986 she was chosen as the American ballerina to represent the United States at a gala celebrating the 40th Anniversary of UNESCO. The gala was held at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow and televised throughout Europe and the USSR. Ashley's broadcast appearances included PBS' Dance in America series (which included Balanchine's Ballo della Regina, Divertimento No. 15, Jewels ("Emeralds"), and The Four Temperaments; and Bournonville's pas de deux from Flower Festival at Genzano) and the "Gala of Stars" in 1980, 1982, 1984, and 1985.</p><title>Dance in America</title><title>Ballo della Regina</title><title>Divertimento No. 15</title><title>Jewels ("Emeralds")</title><title>The Four Temperaments</title><title>Flower Festival at Genzano</title><p>Ashley was a guest artist with many ballet companies, including the Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet in London (dancing in Paquita and The Sleeping Beauty).

In addition, Ashley is the co-author and co-artistic director of the video series The Balanchine Essays, produced by the George Balanchine Foundation. She was also the subject of the 2015 documentary The Dance Goodbye, which documented her career transition following her retirement from performance.

He lived in New York City from 1919 to 1923. Sala chaired the Hispanic Section's Committee on Exhibits in the America's Making exposition of 1921.</p><p>In 1923 Sala had a solo exhibition in New York City and married the writer Monna Alfau. Shortly after the wedding they sailed for Mexico, where he resided until his death at a clinic in Pasadena, California. Sala is also known for his published study of Mexican "marcos de fuego," branded ownership marks on books in colonial libraries, having worked as a bibliographer as well as a painter in Mexico.</p><p>America's Making was an exposition held at the 71st Regiment Armory in New York City from October 29 to November 12, 1921. Its purpose was to present three centuries of immigrant contributions to the nation through educational exhibitions and pageantry. Immigrant groups were classified as racial groups, and included African-Americans. The exposition was formed under the auspices of the New York State and New York City Departments of Education, and carried out by voluntary committees for each group under the organization America's Making, Inc. Its president was John Huston Finley (1863-1940), an educator, editor, author and civic leader.</p><p>Participating ethnic groups, called racial and lineage groups in the exposition, were usually led by prominent persons backed by executive and working committees. During the organizational period for the Hispanic immigrant group (later Americans of Hispanic Lineage), officers of the Hispanic Division were distinct from the executive committee members of the Hispanic Section, who headed various committees (such as Exhibits, Pageantry, etc.) to carry out plans. Rafael Sala was Chair of the Hispanic Section's Committee on Exhibits and thus a member of the Section's Executive Committee. As the date of the event approached, the term "Hispanic Section" was generally used by all concerned to refer to the Hispanic group's organization as a whole. In the case of Americans of Hispanic Lineage, the working committees are not listed in the commemorative publication The Book of America's Making Exposition (1921). Under the Lineage group's leaders (two of whom had appeared as officers on Hispanic Division letterhead) a single committee is listed, including Rafael Sala. The leaders and committee members together are identical to the members of the "Comite Organizadora" identified in "Contribuciones Hispánicas…," a typescript memorandum prepared on the eve of the exposition by the Hispanic Section, containing an urgent plea for funds.</p><title>The Book of America's Making Exposition</title></biogHist>	Rafael Sala papers relating to the America's Making exposition, 1920-1921 (The New York Public Library.

Her birth date remains uncertain, but she was born in London, and was still a minor on 24 April 1818 when she married Thomas Morgan (1786-1862), of Dixon, Morgan and Co., wine and spirits traders. A stained glass window in St. Olave's Church, Hart Street, bears an armorial decoration commemorating the union. Elizabeth was a close friend of the novelist Jane Porter; she signed her letters to Porter with the nickname "Belinda." The Morgans had at least five children: Thomas (1819-1892), who helped run the family business in London; Francis (1820-1876), who moved to Spain to handle the family business's connections there; Aaron Augustus (1822-1888), a clergyman and Shakespeare scholar; Emily Eustatia, married name Gruggen (1828-1909); and Adelaide Elizabeth, married name Beresford (1837-1902). Elizabeth Morgan died at the age of 65, and was buried in All Souls, Kensal Green on 9 July 1866. Her grandson, Fr. Francis Xavier Morgan (1857-1935) was the legal guardian of the fantasy writer J.

His parents, Adolph Julius Hauerbach and Hansena Olsen, were Danes who had converted to Mormonism and migrated to the United States in 1863 (Harbach changed the spelling of his name in 1917). Encouraged by his family, Harbach headed east to Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois. There he distinguished himself, becoming first the oratorical champion of the college, and then winning the state championship in 1895 in a contest for which William Jennings Bryan was one of the judges. After graduation Harbach accepted a professorship in English at Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington. In 1901 he arrived in New York to work on a Ph.D. at Columbia, but a lack of funds soon led him to work as a journalist and later as an advertising copywriter.</p><p>During his years in New York, Harbach began to think of Broadway as a career and while office work occupied his days, his free time was spent working with Karl Hoschna, his first collaborator, trying to create and sell a musical. It wasn't until 1908, after the success of Three Twins, for which Hoschna was the composer, that Harbach quit his job and devoted himself to writing. Over the course of his career Harbach had more than 50 works produced on Broadway. He was also well-known as a "script doctor", rewriting and revising plays for various producers. Harbach's own works were, for the most part, musicals for which he provided both the book and the lyrics. His contributions were not only memorable lyrics and credible plots, but also a new style of musical, where the songs were an integral part of the story. Among his collaborators were the composers Karl Hoschna, Rudolf Friml, Jerome Kern, Louis Hirsch, Herbert Stothart, Vincent Youmans and Sigmund Romberg, and the lyricists Oscar Hammerstein II, Irving Caesar, Frank Mandel, and John Murray Anderson. Harbach's most well-known works include the songs "Love Nest,","Smoke Gets in Your Eyes," "Indian Love Call," "One Alone," "Rose Marie," "The Night Was Made for Love,", and the plays The Firefly; Roberta; Rose Marie; No, No, Nanette; Desert Song; Kid Boots; The Song of the Flame; and The Cat and the Fiddle. Harbach also wrote several non-musical plays including Up in Mabel's Room and The Silent Witness.</p><title>Three Twins</title><title>The Firefly</title><title>Roberta</title><title>Rose Marie</title><title>No, No, Nanette</title><title>Desert Song</title><title>Kid Boots</title><title>The Song of the Flame</title><title>The Cat and the Fiddle</title><title>Up in Mabel's Room</title><title>The Silent Witness</title><p>Harbach worked with major Broadway figures of his day on a creative basis to enhance the profession as a whole through the American Society of Composer's Authors and Publishers (ASCAP). Joining as a charter member in 1914, he worked with ASCAP for more than 40 years as a director, and served as president from 1950-1953. By all accounts his colleagues not only admired his work, but respected the man. Socially, Harbach belonged to the Lambs, the Friars and the Dutch Treat Club, but much of his time was spent with his family at their home in Mamaroneck, New York, where Harbach also did much of his work.</p><p>Harbach married Ella Smith Dougall in Salt Lake City in 1918. They had two sons, Robert and William. The family also included Ella's children from her previous marriage, Bernard and Virginia Dougall. Otto Harbach died in New York in 1963.</p></biogHist>	Otto Harbach papers, Additions, 1923-1979 (The New York Public Library.
